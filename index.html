            We introduce MDT-Bench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate clinical decision-making in a realistic multidisciplinary team (MDT) setting. Comprising 12,910 samples sourced from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) medical records and spanning over twenty clinical specialties (e.g., Pulmonary/Critical Care, Hematology/Oncology, Infectious Diseases), MDT-Bench transforms authentic cases into structured, multi-role and multi-turn dialogues. Each dialogue captures the sequential flow of medical processes, from initial patient screening and history-taking to diagnostic reasoning and treatment management. Our dataset uniquely models the interactive and collaborative nature of real clinical practice, where diverse expertise is integrated through dynamic feedback, error detection, and iterative decision refinement. By challenging foundation models to maintain clinical coherence, personalize reasoning, and integrate multimodal data, MDT-Bench bridges the gap between artificial and expert human performance in healthcare. Ultimately, this benchmark provides a vital tool for advancing research on collaborative medical decision-making, fostering improved AI support in clinical environments, and guiding the next generation of multidisciplinary medical AI systems.

This result reveals that the recent models (e.g. o3-mini, deepseek-r1, and gemini-2.0-flash) typically start with high baseline hallucination resistance and tend to see moderate but consistent gains from a simple CoT, while previous models including medical-purpose LLMs often begin at low hallucination resistance yet can benefit from different approaches (e.g. Search, CoT, and System Prompt). Moreover, retrieval-augmented generation can be less effective if the model struggles to reconcile retrieved information with its internal knowledge.</figcaption>

	abstract = {Foundation Models that are capable of processing and generating multi-modal data have transformed AI{\textquoteright}s role in medicine. However, a key limitation of their reliability is hallucination, where inaccurate or fabricated information can impact clinical decisions and patient safety. We define medical hallucination as any instance in which a model generates misleading medical content. This paper examines the unique characteristics, causes, and implications of medical hallucinations, with a particular focus on how these errors manifest themselves in real-world clinical scenarios. Our contributions include (1) a taxonomy for understanding and addressing medical hallucinations, (2) benchmarking models using medical hallucination dataset and physician-annotated LLM responses to real medical cases, providing direct insight into the clinical impact of hallucinations, and (3) a multi-national clinician survey on their experiences with medical hallucinations. Our results reveal that inference techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Search Augmented Generation can effectively reduce hallucination rates. However, despite these improvements, non-trivial levels of hallucination persist. These findings underscore the ethical and practical imperative for robust detection and mitigation strategies, establishing a foundation for regulatory policies that prioritize patient safety and maintain clinical integrity as AI becomes more integrated into healthcare. The feedback from clinicians highlights the urgent need for not only technical advances but also for clearer ethical and regulatory guidelines to ensure patient safety.
